# Rosary Prayer App for Lent
This project aims to assist the faithful in praying the Rosary during all the various types of Lenten periods observed throughout the year in the Catholic Church. Currently, the app focuses on the specific Lenten devotion of "40 Days with Saint Michael the Archangel."

## Features
- *40-Day Lent Journey:* The app provides a list of 40 items, each representing one day of the Lenten period.
- *Daily Meditation:* Every day includes a unique theme to contemplate the mysteries of the Holy Rosary.

While the app currently supports only the "40 Days with Saint Michael the Archangel" Lent, future updates will include additional Lenten periods observed in the Catholic tradition.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this app is to offer a structured way for users to follow and pray the Rosary, deepening their spiritual experience during Lent through themed daily meditations.

## Future Development
- Expansion to cover all types of Lenten periods throughout the liturgical year.
- Enhanced features for deeper engagement in prayer and reflection.
